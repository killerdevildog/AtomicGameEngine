## ‚öôÔ∏è Maintenance Notice

**This project is now actively maintained by [killerdevildog](https://github.com/killerdevildog).**  
When I discovered the Atomic Game Engine it had been archived and unmaintained, so I‚Äôve taken on stewardship to keep it alive and modern.

> **Important:** The CEF version bundled with Atomic is over **10 years old** and depends on deprecated libraries that modern Ubuntu releases (including 24.04) no longer include by default. A key part of this maintenance effort will be bumping CEF to a supported, up‚Äëto‚Äëdate release.

### üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

1. **Update CEF submodule**  
   - Current CEF is ancient (10+ years) and relies on obsolete Ubuntu libraries.  
   - Bump to the latest CEF release from [killerdevildog/cef](https://github.com/killerdevildog/cef).  
2. **Primary platform support**  
   - Ensure the engine builds and runs smoothly on **Ubuntu‚ÄØ24.04 LTS** and other major Linux distributions.  
   - Native Windows support via Visual Studio/MSVC.  
3. **Secondary platform support**  
   - macOS, Android, iOS, and WebGL builds will follow once the Linux/Windows workflow is solid.  
4. **Future direction**  
   - After full Ubuntu‚ÄØ24.04 compatibility, I‚Äôll evaluate ongoing feature work.  
   - With GitHub Copilot assistance, I plan to maintain and push updates more frequently than past maintainers.

#### Please note that Atomic was originally archived and is no longer officially supported by the original maintainers.  
**Issues** may not be addressed, but pull requests‚Äîespecially those fixing build or runtime issues‚Äîare welcome and will be reviewed.
